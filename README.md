# langchain
##This notebook serves as an introduction to key functionalities within the LangChain library. It demonstrates connecting to OpenAI's chat models and performing basic interactions. We explore the use of PromptTemplate to structure inputs for large language models (LLMs). The notebook shows how to create and run LLMChain for simple conversational sequences. It also illustrates building more complex workflows by combining chains using SimpleSequentialChain. A practical text processing task is demonstrated with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for breaking down long texts. Finally, the notebook showcases how to generate vector embeddings from text using OpenAIEmbeddings. This allows for representing text data in a numerical format, useful for various downstream tasks. Overall, this code provides a hands-on look at essential LangChain components for building LLM-powered applications. It covers the flow from interacting with LLMs to processing and embedding text data. The examples are designed to be straightforward and build upon each other. This notebook serves as a good starting point for those new to LangChain and its capabilities. It highlights how LangChain simplifies the process of working with LLMs and external data. You can adapt these examples to build your own more complex LangChain applications. The use of .env for API keys is demonstrated for secure credential management.
